## Introduction

This simple api only has one route that is responsible to to create orders or add new items to existing ones. Products can have as many special price rules consisting of `quantity` and `price`. So, some products are multi-priced: _buy n of them, and theyâ€™ll cost you less than buying them individually_.

The only route (`/api/checkout`) accepts below parameters:

-   **product** - The ID of the product.
-   **quantity** - Quantity of the items to checkout.
-   **order** - _(optional)_ The ID of the order. If exists, instead of creating a new order it will try to find the corespondent order and update it.

The API is developed upon lovely and powerful [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework version [8.40](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x).

## Installation

### Requirements

-   [A kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/) (Ingress enabled)
-   [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/)
-   Linux-based OS (or having [gitbash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) in windows)

### Instructions

When you made sure your system meets the [requirements](#requirements), clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amin-bf/devolon-task devolon
```

The above command will create a directory named `devolon` and clones the repo in it.

That's it. its installed.

## Usage

-   [Initialization Script](#initialization-script)
-   [Initializing](#initializing)
-   [Running Tests](#running-tests)
-   [Suspending](#suspending)

### Initialization Script

The repo is shipped with a script &dash;[k8s](https://github.com/amin-bf/devolon-task/blob/main/k8s)&dash; to initialize and config the application.

The script accepts below arguments:

-   **start**: Initialize and fire-ups (_deploys to kubernetes_) the application.
-   **stop**: Deletes all kubernetes resources (Deployment, Services, Ingresses, and etc.)
-   **cmd COMMAND**: Runs any terminal command in repo's root directory, like `php artisan migrate`
-   **lara-init**: Initializes laravel framework and migrates and seeds the database, Only runs in kubernetes environment and you can not run it on your local machine.

### Initializing

In terminal, switch to repo root directory, then run [Initialization Script](#initialization-script)'s `start` command.

```bash
./k8s start
```

It will:

1. Configure application and generate kubernetes' resources config `.yaml` files.
2. Asks you to provide a domain name to set for the API access. It defaults to `checkout.local`.
3. Deploys application and its database to your kubernetes cluster using `skaffold` command-line application.
4. After success deployment and just before running the main container's default command (serving php application), it will run [Initialization Script](#initialization-script)'s `lara-init` command, resulting in:
    1. Installing composer packages using `composer i` command.
    2. Generating a new secret application key for laravel framework.
    3. Migrating and seeding the database using `php artisan migrate --seed` command.
    4. Changing the ownership of all files and directories ender repo's root directory to `$WWWUSER:$WWWUSER`, which is passed to the pod as an environment variable and equals to your local user's ID

You can have a brand clean database by running below command:

```bash
./k8s cmd php artisan migrate:fresh
```

### Running Tests

You can simply run the tests using [Initialization Script](#initialization-script)'s `cmd` command:

```bash
./k8s cmd php artisan test
```

All the tests that use persistent data in database, use an alternative database (`devolon_db_test`) and will not pollute the main application database (`devolon_db`).

### Suspending

To down the application deleting all the kubernetes resources use [Initialization Script](#initialization-script)'s `stop` command.

```bash
./k8s stop
```

## Known issues and limitations

Users who are fan of windows might have some difficulties using [Initialization Script](#initialization-script)'s `stop` command, especially with auto-injection of `pwd` into `./deployment.yaml`.

No other issues are known yet.
